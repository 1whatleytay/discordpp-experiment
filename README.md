# discordpp - A C++ discord bot library experiment.

I tried to finish this library because I was enjoying C++ at the time and I wanted to learn the discord API.
I got decently far, tried initially to make my own TLS implementation (stupid, don't do).
Then I made it to websockets and gave up.
I tried to find a good websockets library but I wasn't happy with my actual sockets implementation and forgot about it.
Uploaded here for reference purposes.
